/*  -INFORMATION-
	Subject:	ToD Campaign Special Weapons List
	Effect:		This script adds a number of weapons and equipment packs for a ToD Campaign
				This is original content adapted from different sources (will credit authors once I figure out how to work this properly)
				This content is made by Eugenio Curia
	Code by:	MorePurpleMoreBetter
	Date:		2022-04-11 (sheet v13.00.00)
				The code will work in v12.999 but will require closing and opening the sheet before the packs are available
	Please support the creator of this content (Jason Mendell) and download his material from DM Guild: https://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?author=Jason%20Mendell
	IMPORTANT: adding this script will remove a couple of alternative names for weapons (e.g. longsword will no longer trigger for anything other than just 'longsword')
	Note that this content is not balanced well for all weapons and the official D&D 5e rules state that you are better off using the weapon stats from the PHB and switching out their names for something else (e.g. the sickle stats fit a kama)
